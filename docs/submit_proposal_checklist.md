### Saving and resuming work
- Drafts are autosaved every time you change a field. Wait for the green **“Saved”** badge before closing the page.
- To continue on another device, go to **Event Management Suite → Event Proposal → Drafts** and open the listed draft. The same form will be pre-filled with your saved data.
- Use the **Reset Draft** action if you need to discard the current draft and start fresh.

Keeping these details ready in advance will make the proposal submission faster and reduce back-and-forth during review.
